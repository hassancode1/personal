- **Image Optimization** - Automatic image optimization and lazy loading
- **Built-in CSS Support** - Support for CSS Modules, Sass, and CSS-in-JS
- **TypeScript Support** - First-class TypeScript support
- **API Routes** - Full-stack capabilities with API endpoints

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Shadcn UI** - Modern component library
- **MDX** - Markdown with JSX for blog posts
- **Vercel** - Deployment and hosting platform

## Why Next.js?
